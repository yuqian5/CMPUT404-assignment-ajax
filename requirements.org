* Explore using AJAX to make a shared state interactive application
** Description

   Your task is to fill in the blanks and connect your browser to your
   webservice via AJAX. We won't be using XML here unless you want
   to. I recommend JSON.

   Your task is to get this shared drawing program to work using AJAX.

   This program allows numerous clients to connect and draw on the
   same surface and share the drawing they have made with anyone who
   is currently on.

   The goal here is for you to understand the very basics of AJAX,
   learn a little about canvas, learn a little bit about the overhead
   of AJAX, learn about JSON and other technologies. Also you'll get
   to learn about the flask micro-framework.

** Collaboration
   - You may consult with others but the submission should be your
     own source code.
   - Collaboration must be documented in the README.md file
   - Any external source code must be referenced and documented in
     the README.md file

** User Stories
   - As a web browser user I want to draw on the canvas
   - As a web browser user I want to see others drawing on the canvas
   - As a web browser user I want the system to be responsive to my
     actions (< 100ms)
   - As a web browser user I want to watch as other users draw on the
     canvas
   - As a web service user I want to get access to the world
   - As a web service user I want to post entities that have at least
     'x' and 'y' co-ordinates
   - As a web service user I will probably ping the system a lot to
     get updates.

** Requirements
   
   - [X] Implement the AJAX Javascript parts in the HTML file static/index.htm
   - [X] Implement the webservice root
   - [X] Implement the webservice /entity/entity-name POST/PUT/GET API
   - [X] Implement the webservice /world API
   - [X] Implement the webservice /clear API
   - [X] Use JSON or XML to communicate (no plain text!)
   - [X] The webservice can pass all the tests in freetests.py
   - [-] The webservice can pass all the tests in not-free-tests.py (you only have part of this one, I reserve the right to add tests)
   - [X] The webservice can serve /static/index.html
   - [X] static/index.html displays the current state of the webservice
   - [X] static/index.html responds to clicks within 100ms on average
   - [X] Make static/index.html images look nice
   - [X] implement anything marked XXX TODO: in static/index.html
   - [X] /clear returns the current state of the world {}
   - [X] PUT returns the object that was PUT.
   - [X] http://hostname:5000/static/index.html will work to produce the UI
         (so http://127.0.0.1:5000/static/index.html should work and http://localhost:5000/static/index.html should work)
   - [X] Doesn't abuse POST, doesn't poll /world with POST method.

 
** Restrictions
   - [ ] Use Python 3.6
   - [ ] Must run in the VM (Ubuntu 18.10)
   - [X] License your code properly (use an OSI approved license)
     - Put your name on it!

** Submission Instructions
   - Fork my repository from github
     https://github.com/abramhindle/CMPUT404-assignment-ajax
   - Push your commits to your fork
   - In EClass for this assignment submit a URL to the git
     repository. I would prefer github for the host.
     - Line 1: the git URL
     - Line 2: Your CCID

   - To mark your assignment I should be able to type:
     git clone http://github.com/youruserid/thisassignment.git yourccid
     cd yourccid
     python freetests.py

   - Marks will be deducted if I cannot successfully do this.
     
   - Marks will be deducted for using library code that does the assignment


** Marking
   - Excellent 7/7: All tests pass (free and notfree), Meets
     requirements. Looks SIGNIFICANTLY better than what I gave you.
     Runs flawlessly in the browser (latency and synchronization).
     Uses POST and GET appropriately. Doesn't POST to /world to retrieve world.
   - Good 6/7: All tests pass (free and notfree), Meets
     requirements. Looks better than what I gave you.
     Runs flawlessly in the browser (latency and synchronization).
     Uses POST and GET appropriately. Doesn't POST to /world to retrieve world.
   - Satisfactory 5/7: All tests pass (free and notfree), meets most
     requirements. Could look like what I gave or perhaps some minor
     browser issues (latency and synchronization).
     Maybe misuses POST or GET: uses POST to /world to retrieve world.
   - Unsatisfactory 3/7: All tests pass (free and notfree). Clearly
     limited effort. UI looks poor, browser issues such as latency and
     synchronization.
   - Failure 0/7: Any test fails. Browser doesn't work. No
     synchronization in browser. Missing parts. Incomplete.
